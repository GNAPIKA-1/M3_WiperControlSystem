# ABSTRACT
## Project Name:
***Wiper Control System***
## Objective:
In this project, a high-performance **Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core**, STM32F407VG Microcontroller Board is used to demonstrate the working of ***Wiper Control System*** of an automobile at different states of modes.
## Brief Explanation of Project:
Automobiles have a unique design **ignition switch system**. The switch controls all the necessary components in the vehicle.The traditional vehicles with standard ignition system have four key positions. But modern vehicles have only three key positions.There is a specific action for every time you turn on the ignition switch.The ignition switch is the major part of an automobile and it is very important to keep this switch in the right shape.
The second position switch is the **ACC/ACCESSORY position, which allows you to use your radio, windshield wipers**, and other accessories while the engine is off. This position should also be used in the event that your vehicle is being pushed or towed. In this position, the engine is off.(The next one is the ignition position. All the electronic accessories come active when you turn on the ignition switch in this mode. According to the expert maintenance tips, the ***ON position*** is the default position in vehicles.)
