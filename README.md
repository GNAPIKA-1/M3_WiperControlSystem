# M3_WiperControlSystem
A high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core, STM32F407VG Microcontroller Board is used to demonstrate the working of Wiper Control System of an automobile at different states of modes and positioning the Wiper.
## Working principle
* Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. 
* If the push button is long pressed , the first led (red) will turn on. Hence, the engine starts.
* Clicking the push button again, the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on, moving at a desired rate. 
* If the button is clicked again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. 
* With the fourth press,  the fourth led (orange) will turn on, and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. 
* The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth press which would a long press.
